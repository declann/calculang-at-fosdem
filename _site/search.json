Your IP address and other information may be made available to them; they will then aggregate information I can use to understand website audience, improve the website/content, and to consider reach and effectiveness of the website/content. I do not get or store raw data such as IP address.\nIf you “reject non-essential” the cookie banner, or if you disable analytics scripts, or if you make no action at all, then analytics functionality is not used. No information is made available to Plausible, including your IP address.
